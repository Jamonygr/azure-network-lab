# Monitoring modules

## log-analytics

Creates a Log Analytics workspace for diagnostics and future extensions. The root module does not currently wire diagnostic settings to it, so treat it as a placeholder for lab expansion.

## Extension ideas

- Enable diagnostics for vHub, Firewall, and VPN gateways.
- Forward NSG flow logs to the workspace.
